## Gameplay and Geometric Background

*Mental Yoga* is an educational research application that transforms cube-related spatial reasoning problems into a sequence of interactive, game-like tasks.

The core geometric focus of the game is the transformation between a **three-dimensional cube** and its corresponding **two-dimensional nets**. A cube can be unfolded into **11 topologically distinct valid nets** (excluding rotations and reflections), and understanding the relationships between faces, edges, and vertices across these transformations is central to the gameplay.

The game consists of **six levels**, progressing from perceptual recognition to more advanced spatial transformation and mental rotation tasks.

### Level Overview

**Level 1 — Net Validity**  
Players are shown a 2D net and must determine whether it can be folded into a valid cube.

**Level 2 — Opposite Faces**  
Given a valid cube net with one face marked, players identify the face that would be opposite to it once the net is folded into a cube.

**Level 3 — Overlapping Edges**  
Players are shown a cube net with a marked edge and must identify another edge on the net that would overlap with it in the folded cube.

**Level 4 — Overlapping Vertices**  
Given a cube net with a marked vertex, players identify the other two vertices that coincide with it when the net is folded.

**Level 5 — Face Orientation Mapping**  
Players are given:
- a folded cube with an arrow on one face,
- a corresponding cube net, and
- a designated base face.

The task is to correctly place and orient the arrow on the net so that, after folding, it matches the orientation shown on the cube.

**Level 6 — Cube Rotation and Net Correspondence**  
Players are given:
- a cube and a net with identical face patterns, and
- a designated base face on the net.

Players must rotate the cube so that, when placed on the base and unfolded into the net, all faces correspond correctly to the given net configuration.


## Game Layer: Theme and Design Rationale

Although *Mental Yoga* is grounded in precise geometric reasoning, the game deliberately avoids presenting abstract, lifeless geometric objects in a purely formal way. A direct, textbook-style representation of cubes and nets risks positioning players in a rigid “learning-only” mindset, which can increase cognitive resistance and reduce engagement.

To address this, the application introduces a **lightweight game layer** that wraps the core geometric tasks in a narrative and visual metaphor, without altering the underlying mathematical structure.

### The Metaphor of “Mental Yoga”

The name *Mental Yoga* reflects a common subjective experience during spatial transformation tasks:  
when reasoning about cube-to-net transformations, the mind often feels as though it is being stretched, twisted, folded, and reoriented—much like performing yoga poses.

This metaphor is intentionally chosen to:
- legitimize cognitive effort as a form of mental flexibility rather than difficulty,
- frame spatial struggle as an active, embodied process, and
- normalize moments of confusion as part of exploration rather than failure.

### World Setting and Cube Characters

The game is set in a fictional, magical world inhabited by **cube-like creatures**. In this world, transforming between cube and net forms is not a school exercise, but a natural activity—akin to how these creatures stretch, fold, and reshape their bodies.

Each problem level is presented through a cube character, allowing:
- abstract geometric relations (faces, edges, vertices) to be grounded in character-centered representations,
- transformations to be perceived as meaningful actions rather than mechanical operations, and
- continuity across levels without introducing extraneous rules or narratives.

Importantly, this game layer is designed to be **thin and non-intrusive**:
it supports motivation, imagination, and affective engagement, while leaving the geometric reasoning itself unchanged and fully analyzable for research purposes.

### Design Philosophy

The game layer follows three guiding principles:

1. **Conceptual Transparency**  
   Narrative and visual elements should never obscure the geometric structure of the task.

2. **Minimal Narrative Commitment**  
   The world provides context and metaphor, not plot progression or role-playing mechanics.

3. **Research Compatibility**  
   All game elements are designed to coexist with rigorous experimental control, data logging, and reproducibility.

In this way, *Mental Yoga* aims to create a learning environment where players feel invited into a space of exploration, rather than pulled into a conventional instructional setting.
